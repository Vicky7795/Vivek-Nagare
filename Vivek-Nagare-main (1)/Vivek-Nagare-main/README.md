* HTML Introduction:-> HTML (HyperText Markup Language) is the basic language used to build web pages. It creates the structure of a webpage using different tags and elements that tell the browser how to show                            text, images, and links.

* HTML Elements:-> An HTML element includes a start tag, content, and an end tag. It tells the browser how each part of the webpage should appear and behave.

* Nested HTML Elements:-> Nested elements are HTML elements placed inside other elements. Every webpage is built using multiple elements inside one another like `<html>`, `<body>`, `<h1>`, and `<p>`.

* HTML Attributes:-> Attributes provide extra information about elements and are written inside start tags as name="value". They control features like links, images, size, and location of content.

* HTML Headings:-> HTML headings are used to create main titles and subheadings on a webpage. They range from `<h1>` (largest) to `<h6>` (smallest) to organize content properly.

* HTML Paragraphs:-> HTML paragraphs display text content on a webpage using the `<p>` tag. Each paragraph starts on a new line with space before and after it.

* HTML Styles:-> The style attribute is used to apply simple design changes like color, size, and background directly to HTML elements. It changes how the content looks on the page.

* HTML Text Formatting:-> Text formatting in HTML is used to change the appearance or importance of text. Tags like `<b>`, `<i>`, `<strong>`, and `<em>` make text bold, italic, or important.

* HTML Quotation:-> HTML quotation elements display quoted text or references. Tags such as `<blockquote>` and `<q>` are used to show long and short quotations clearly.

* HTML Comments:-> HTML comments are notes written inside the code that do not appear on the webpage. They help explain code or hide parts temporarily using `<!-- -->`.

* HTML Colors:-> HTML colors are used to style text, backgrounds, and elements. They can be applied using color names, HEX codes, or RGB values through the style attribute.

* CSS (HTML Styles - CSS):-> CSS is used to design and decorate webpages by controlling layout, colors, fonts, and spacing. It can be applied inline, internally using `<style>`, or externally using a CSS file.

* HTML Links:-> HTML links connect one webpage to another and are created using the `<a>` tag. The `href` attribute gives the destination, and `target` controls where the link opens.

* **HTML Head Element :** The `<head>` section stores information about the webpage such as title, meta data, styles, and scripts that are not directly visible on the page.

* **HTML Layout :** HTML layout elements organize content into sections like header, navigation, article, and footer to create a structured webpage.
